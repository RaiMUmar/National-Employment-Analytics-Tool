# Job Market Insights: Canada

A Python-based data visualization tool that explores the relationship between job vacancies, education levels, and income across Canadian provinces. The tool provides insights into provincial trends by reading, cleaning, and merging government datasets (CSV format), and rendering visual correlations using `matplotlib`.
